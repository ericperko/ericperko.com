I am the current maintainer of the ROS repository for the [Case Western Reserve University Mobile Robotics Lab](http://mobilerobots.case.edu). Code in this repository is used on our [IGVC](/igvc) robots, by Roberto, the EECS deptartment's robotic tour guide (or will be someday) and by the Mobile Robotics class offered every spring.

Released code includes a driver for the [Neato XV-11 Laser](http://www.ros.org/wiki/xv_11_laser_driver) as well as a ROS node that allows one to use a static map as a constant observation source for the navigation stack's costmaps. See the [cwru_nav](http://www.ros.org/wiki/cwru_nav) wiki page for details on that node.

See the [cwru-ros-pkg](http://www.ros.org/wiki/cwru-ros-pkg) ROS.org wiki page for more details.
