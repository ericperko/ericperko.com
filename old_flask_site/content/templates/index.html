    <div class="about">
	    I'm Eric Perko, a staff Software Engineer at Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Enginering Center (<a href="http://www.rec.ri.cmu.edu/">NREC</a>). I received an M.S. in Computing and Information Science from <a href="http://cwru.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a>. The focus of my degree was on robotics and artificial intelligence, with my MS thesis addressing precision navigation for a robotic wheelchair. As part of that work, I leveraged the <a href="http://ros.org">Robot Operating System</a> as well as contributed open source code to the ROS community. I am currently the maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/cwru-robotics/cwru-ros-pkg">cwru-ros-pkg</a>, which contains all code in use on robots in the Mobile Robotics Lab at CWRU. I am also the maintainer of the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/gps_drivers">gps_drivers</a> and <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/nmea_gps_driver">nmea_gps_driver</a> packages.
