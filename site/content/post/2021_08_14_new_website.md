Finally updated the website after a few years offline and many more years of no updates. 

Now built on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://nearlyfreespeech.net). The old setup using a Flask-based custom framework and a VPS was just overkill.

Take a look at my [about]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) if you don't know where to start.
